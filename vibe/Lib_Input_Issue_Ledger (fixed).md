### LI-044 — AsciiDoc heading levels do not round-trip through the input parser

**Status:** RESOLVED for document titles and body heading levels, 2026-11-14.
**Lambda task blocker:** cleared for the exercised rich-editing path. D9.3.4
governs document processing.

The AsciiDoc reader places a document title in `meta.title` and maps body
section markers to h1–h5. Markdown output and input carry metadata in YAML
front matter, including through the editor's existing front-matter envelope;
strict CommonMark remains unaffected. Generic markup detects the actual input
URL filename, while explicitly requested Markdown takes precedence over it.
Native controls cover title escaping, section levels, metadata round trips,
source positions and explicit format selection. The original wiki assertion
continues to pass (`temp/li044-roundtrip-dispatch.log`).

The original Lambda parse/format/parse probe preserves the title
(`temp/li044-lambda-roundtrip-current.log`), and six editor import, edit, export
and reopen checks pass (`temp/li044-editor-probe-current.log`).
The isolated host links existing Lambda and Radiant debug objects with the
current input archives; hashes are in `temp/li026-comparison-binaries.json`.
This is a focused integration check, not a fresh full Lambda baseline. The
input aggregate completed 109 executables with 5,291 passed, the existing
LI-002 and two LI-003 failures, and one font-dependent skip
(`temp/li044-li026-input-baseline.log`). The release build and debug and
release boundary audits pass (`temp/li044-li026-release-build.log`,
`temp/li044-li026-boundary-debug.log`, `temp/li044-li026-boundary-release.log`).

<details><summary>Original report and investigation</summary>

**Original report:** the issue blocked rich editing of AsciiDoc headings.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/markup-roundtrip-probe.ls`.
The AsciiDoc source `= Title\n\nHello _world_.\n` parses its heading as h1.
Formatting the equivalent Mark Doc with the Lambda AsciiDoc writer produces
`== Title`, which the input parser reads as h2. The writer reserves `= Title`
for document metadata and maps body h1 to `==`, while the input parser maps
`==` to h2. This existing reader/writer mismatch is also documented in
`doc/Script_Formats_Support.md` under the current round-trip results. The editor
falls back to source instead of changing heading levels. Evidence:
`Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/markup-roundtrip-probe.log`. The cross-owner
handoff is recorded in the [Lambda ledger](../../Lambda/vibe/Lambda_Issue_Ledger.md#input-format-integration-handoffs--2026-11-14).

2026-11-14 ownership review: the input adapter currently maps the number of
leading equals signs directly to a body heading. The Lambda writer's documented
profile instead reserves a single equals sign for `meta.title` and starts body
headings at two. Mapping only `==` to h1 would leave the document title as a
body heading and would not implement that model. Moving the title into `meta`
also affects the existing Markdown conversion path, whose input-owned writer
currently skips metadata, so the reported Markdown-mediated round trip needs
an agreed title-preservation path across the owners. No parser mapping has been
changed as an isolated workaround.


**Earlier source follow-up, 2026-11-14:** two focused native controls built
against the current debug archives reproduce both reader mismatches: `= Title`
is a body h1 with no metadata, and `== Section` is a body h2
(`temp/li044-current-probe.cpp`, `temp/li044-current-probe.log`). The Lambda
editor's `format/markup.ls` formats its parsed document as Markdown and later
reparses Markdown before calling the AsciiDoc writer. Input's Markdown formatter
skips `meta`, so the writer cannot recover a title moved there by the corrected
reader. The Lambda handoff now records this editor integration blocker. A
title-preserving bridge or an established equivalent contract is needed before
the reported editing round trip can be closed; its representation is not yet
established. No heading-only workaround has been applied.

### LI-026 — Calmind CDN rejects a valid compressed resource request profile

**Status:** RESOLVED for the observed first-party resource rejection,
2026-11-14. **Lambda blocker:** cleared for the tested CSS and image loading.
Network ownership follows **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**.

The resource backends omitted the `Accept-Language` already sent on document
navigation. The CDN's response varied on that header when the valid document
Referer was present: 15 paired controls without the language header returned
403, and all 15 with it returned 200 across CSS, image and script requests
(`temp/li026-paired-controls/results.json`). Both resource backends now send
the document's language preference. Referer, codec negotiation and TLS
verification are unchanged. A loopback server that requires both the Referer
and language preference fails both backends before the repair and passes after
(`temp/li026-regression-before.log`, `temp/li026-regression-after.log`).

Two interleaved native renders per version used pinned hosts and fresh caches.
Both before runs saw 24 first-party 403s and all three stylesheets failed;
both after runs saw no first-party HTTP failures or stylesheet failures. All
three decoded cached stylesheets in both after runs match independent identity
responses by SHA-256 (`temp/li026-render-pairs/css-equality.json`). The visible
page restores its styles and images against an independently captured Chromium
view (`temp/li026-render-pairs/`, `temp/li026-browser.png`). Live server
behavior can change; this is not a claim of general CDN compatibility. The
Lambda ledger records separately observed page-script and event-loop failures.
The input aggregate completed 109 executables with 5,291 passed, the existing
LI-002 and two LI-003 failures, and one font-dependent skip
(`temp/li044-li026-input-baseline.log`). The release build and debug and
release boundary audits pass (`temp/li044-li026-release-build.log`,
`temp/li044-li026-boundary-debug.log`, `temp/li044-li026-boundary-release.log`).

<details><summary>Original report and investigation</summary>

**Original report:** the capture completed with missing first-party CSS and
images and a major visual difference. The transport cause was unconfirmed.

The current native capture of https://calmind.com/ receives HTTP403 HTML browser
checks for first-party CSS, scripts and images. Fresh headless Chromium receives
200 CSS for all three stylesheets. The resource manager already forwards the
owning document's Referer through CURLOPT_REFERER; adding the same Referer or
copying the current native User-Agent in system curl still receives 200 CSS.

Independent system-curl controls isolate an origin response variation:
`--compressed` advertises the available `deflate, gzip` codecs and receives
HTTP403, 5768 bytes of an HCDN browser-check page, with Vary:Accept-Encoding.
IPv4 gives the same result. Explicit gzip-only, identity, no encoding header or
Chromium's `gzip, deflate, br, zstd` header receives HTTP200 text/css. The valid
native compressed request is not proven malformed; no cookie, TLS, resource
scheduling or script-startup root cause is established by these controls.

Do not disable compression, spoof unsupported codecs, reorder headers for this
host or substitute its CSS solely to match the reference. Broader CDN/browser
challenge interoperability is outside this existing-bug milestone. Evidence:
Lambda `temp/online-visual-round13/calmind-corrected-controls.json`,
`calmind-encoding-controls.json`, saved response headers/bodies,
`calmind-native-probe.png` and `calmind-browser-current.json/png`. An early
User-Agent extraction concatenated following macros; those native/css-accept
controls are superseded by corrected-controls and are not evidence.

2026-11-14 refresh: the current page points to a first-party autoptimized CSS
asset for which system curl received HTTP 200 with compressed, identity, and
absent Accept-Encoding headers. Its URL and response are saved in
`temp/ledger-network-calmind-css-*.log`. This is a current asset, not the
previously captured asset or a native-renderer comparison, so it does not
establish that the original interoperability issue is fixed.


**Earlier native transport follow-up, 2026-11-14:** the current input-owned curl
archive reports Brotli and zlib support. A fresh host-trust native probe
advertised `deflate, gzip, br` and fetched the later autoptimized stylesheet
with HTTP 200, `text/css`, and 213,349 decoded bytes
(`temp/li026-native-probe.cpp`, `temp/li026-native-probe.xml`, and
`temp/li026-native-probe.log`). A system-curl compressed request for that
same later asset also returned 200 (`temp/li026-current-curl.log`). The
original challenge-producing resource is not available in this checkout, and
this probe does not exercise a complete native render or prove the original
CDN rejection fixed. No input transport defect or general repair has been
established; this issue remains open.

### LI-055 — Concurrent allocator factories race while installing release hooks

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. **Lambda blocker:** not established. D5.2.1
governs allocator context registration, and D6.4.4 requires safe registry
initialization.

The pool/arena/scratch factory and the NamePool factory each used an
unsynchronized function-local `installed` flag while writing their global
release hooks. Isolated eight-thread first-use probes, with the respective
factory source instrumented by ThreadSanitizer, report races on both flags
(`temp/ledger-mem-factory-tsan-before.log` and
`temp/ledger-name-factory-tsan-before.log`). The C factory now uses the native
platform's one-time initialization primitive, and the C++ factory uses
thread-safe function-local initialization. The same instrumented probes pass
afterward (`temp/ledger-mem-factory-tsan-after.log` and
`temp/ledger-name-factory-tsan-after.log`). This is a focused sanitizer check,
not whole-program ThreadSanitizer qualification. A separate native executable
exercises concurrent first use, and the existing allocator factory and NamePool
suites pass. Shared allocator reference counting remains open as [LI-053](Lib_Input_Issue_Ledger.md#li-053).

**Completion follow-up, 2026-11-14:** instrumenting the factories together
with the pool, arena, scratch-arena and NamePool implementations exposed the
additional shared `next_pool_id` increment in `pool_init`
(`temp/li055-tsan-pool-id-before.log`). The diagnostic ID sequence now uses
a relaxed atomic increment. The native first-use control also exercises the
scratch release hook and checks that concurrently created pools have distinct
IDs. With all six implementation files and the test instrumented, the control
passes in ten fresh processes (`temp/li055-tsan-repeat.json`); exact source
hashes and compile/link commands are in `temp/li055-tsan-metadata.json`.
This remains focused subsystem instrumentation; other linked archive objects
are not instrumented by this check. The Windows one-time initialization path
is present but has not been qualified on a Windows host.
The complete native baseline, release build and boundary audit evidence is
recorded in the allocator-factory qualification above; its remaining failures
belong to LI-002 and LI-003.

### LI-054 — Parallel native tests start duplicate dependency builders

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. **Lambda blocker:** not established. D9.1.5
governs the JSON-driven build pipeline.

`make -j4 test-input-baseline` started the vendor builder directly and through
the recursive quiet `all` target. Concurrent builders reused ThorVG's staging
directory, and one failed because `libthorvg.a` disappeared before installation
(`temp/ledger-input-baseline-contract-graph.log`; inner build evidence
`temp/ledger-build-dag-inner-before.log`). Native test binaries, the aggregate
and the boundary target now depend on the same nonrecursive build graph, so
make schedules each shared dependency builder once. The pre-change dry-run
control exposes both paths (`temp/ledger-build-dag-control-before.log`), and
the new dependency-builder test checks the combined native-test/boundary graph.
The full parallel baseline reaches every executable; its unrelated test failures
remain listed in the qualification above.

<a id="li-052"></a>

### LI-052 — Nested-array DOM edits diverge from the backing tree

**Status:** RESOLVED for ordinary document-owned nested arrays, 2026-11-14.
Input-owned insertion and removal retain DOM node identity and publish copied
array paths, so earlier shallow document snapshots keep their old contents.
Foreign arrays and specialized multidimensional, view, or sparse arrays are
refused before mutation; those profiles are not claimed qualified. Focused
tests cover nested elements, text, comments, sibling order, wide scalars,
snapshot preservation and ownership refusal in view and non-view modes.
Evidence: `temp/ledger-dom-cow-qualified.log`.

**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-14 on macOS. **Lambda blocker:** not
established. D5.5.2 governs retained DOM ownership and S2.6.4 preserves array
boundaries in element content.

Before the repair, when an element's content contained an array whose child
appeared in the DOM sibling chain, `dom_remove_prepared_backed_child` saw no
direct backing slot and unlinked the wrapper while leaving the array entry.
A later backing-tree consumer could still observe the removed node. The
regression `InputDomNativeTest.NestedArrayEditsKeepOwnedChildOccurrences`
now verifies that removal updates the array. Pre-fix evidence:
`temp/ledger-dom-nested-removal.log`. Inserting before a nested reference also
put the new backing entry after the array even though the DOM link preceded
the reference (`temp/ledger-dom-nested-insertion.log`). The direct-index API remains unchanged. Lambda replacement uses it directly;
the unqualified host path is recorded in the [Lambda ledger](../../Lambda/vibe/Lambda_Issue_Ledger.md#dom-replacement-of-nested-array-children--2026-11-14).

### LI-001 — Graph parser line-budget test fails

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Shared directory enumeration and existing
path/Mark helpers remove duplicate logic while preserving local and brokered
include behavior. The resolver is 272 lines, the header 106, and the six-unit
total 4,407; the unchanged budget test and all 22 graph tests pass.

**Status at report:** OPEN — validation failure. **Observed:** 2026-11-09, macOS,
`make test-input-baseline` (debug). **Lambda blocker:** not established.

`GraphParserTest.ParserLocBudget` in `test/test_graph_parser_gtest.cpp`
reports 306 resolver lines against a limit of 273, 108 header lines against
107, and 4,443 combined lines against 4,409. The other 19 graph parser cases
passed in the same run. Reproduce with
`./build/test/test_graph_parser_native --gtest_filter=GraphParserTest.ParserLocBudget`
after building the baseline. The expected result is that the unchanged budget
check passes; a source simplification or other resolution requires investigation.
This observation does not establish a functional parser regression.

2026-11-14 repair: the shared directory adapter already supports an unlimited
ambient listing. It now retains the directory entry symlink classification even
when target metadata is unavailable, so the resolver can use the same
enumeration path while keeping the broker limit, local symlink exclusion,
canonicalization, and ordering. The resolver also reuses the existing Mark
child and path helpers and resolves the root path once. A duplicate header
declaration was removed. The unchanged controls cover local directories with
more than 4,096 entries, live and dangling symlinks, include cycles and network
rejection, as well as brokered filtering and sorted order. The original test
and all source ceilings remain unchanged. Evidence: `temp/ledger-graph-controls-before.log`
and `temp/ledger-graph-final2.log`.

### LI-013 — Native TeX text-case expansion exhausts its budget on reference controls

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The native reference and undefined-control
case conversions terminate with the kernel encoding dispatch in place. This
does not claim full LaTeX font-selection support. D10.2.2 governs the native
TeX input boundary.

**Status at report:** OPEN — cause unconfirmed. **Observed:** 2026-11-11, macOS debug
native TeX parser. **Script TeX-port blocker:** no; the experimental script
case converter explicitly reports unsupported reference forms it cannot handle.

Running `parse("\\ExplSyntaxOn\\text_uppercase:n{\\ref{aB}/\\pageref{aB}/\\eqref{aB}}\\ExplSyntaxOff", {type: "tex"})`
returns empty text and a `tex-budget` diagnostic after 20,000,000 macro calls,
followed by missing-number and missing-brace diagnostics. Evidence is in
`temp/expl3-script/native-case-refs.out`; the same probe shows `\\label` and
`\\cite` in a different case-conversion argument completing without a budget
diagnostic.

2026-11-14 isolation: `\ref`, `\pageref`, `\relax`, and a defined `\eqref`
complete; undefined `\eqref` and an unrelated undefined command each exhaust
the budget. The bundled expl3 resources were copied into `temp/ledger-expl3/`.
The expl3 predicate correctly reports an undefined token as non-expandable.
Before the repair, the minimal kernel did not define the LaTeX font-encoding controls
`\@current@cmd` and `\@changed@cmd`. In the expl3 text expansion path,
TeX's `\ifx` correctly considers an unrelated undefined control equal to
each undefined encoding control, so expl3 takes its encoding-escape branch
and repeats until the budget is exhausted. A diagnostic preamble defining
both controls prevents this loop, but does not implement their encoding
semantics and is not a fix. The kernel now implements both dispatch controls,
including current-encoding lookup, default-encoding fallback, missing-symbol diagnostics, math warnings,
and protected expansion. Focused controls exercise dispatch, fallback,
missing-symbol reporting, and protection. The opt-in focused regressions
are `TexEngineTest.Expl3ReferenceCaseExpansionTerminates` and
`TexEngineTest.Expl3UndefinedTokenIsNotExpandable`, enabled by
`LAMBDA_INPUT_EXPL3_TEST_DIR`; both pass with the copied resources. Evidence:
`temp/ledger-tex-encoding-suite2.log`, `temp/ledger-expl3-resource-sha256.txt`,
`temp/ledger-expl3-controls.log`,
`temp/ledger-expl3-path2.log`, and `temp/ledger-expl3-kernel-control.log`.

### LI-007 — Shared header retains declarations from the second runtime retirement

**Status:** RESOLVED by the existing header split; revalidated 2026-11-14.


**Status at report:** OPEN — owner header cleanup. **Observed:** 2026-11-10, Lambda
`5f3550a38` plus the second runtime audit. **Lambda blocker:** no; the
36 declarations have no source, generated-import or host-export consumer.
Authority: **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2** (header ownership), **D9.4.6** (host exports).

Lambda's second audit retires 88 functions and 43 runtime-only JIT import rows,
including old array fills/read adapters, scalar/boolean wrappers, map type-list
adapters and unused COW profiling adapters. Input's `lambda/lambda.h` still
advertises 36 of these removed functions. The expected result is that the
shared ABI header declares only the remaining implementation surface.

Exact declaration inventory and prepared, unapplied patch:
`../lambda/temp/mvp_legacy_reaudit/input-declarations.json` and
`../lambda/temp/mvp_legacy_reaudit/input-header.patch`. Reproduce the inventory
from Lambda with `python3 temp/mvp_legacy_reaudit/post_audit.py`; the original
caller audit is `selected-before.json` in the same directory. This is a stale
header issue, not a reproduced input parser defect. Lambda's runtime builds
without those definitions because no consumer remains. The native math catalog,
Radiant's `fn_call3_into` assembly alias and unary imported-predicate trampoline
are retained. No input/Radiant source or header is edited in this follow-up;
the earlier LI-006 exception was scoped to its region patch only.

Implementation and qualification record:
`../lambda/vibe/impl/Lambda_Impl_MIR_Full_Retirement.md`, second runtime audit.

2026-11-14 review: neither sibling checkout retains the referenced temporary
inventory or patch. The inventory was reconstructed from Lambda retirement
commit `1a038ece67` and the pre-split input header: all 36 matching removed
function definitions had declarations there, and none remains in the current
`lambda/lambda.h`. Input commit `b2a13ec` removed the declarations as part of
the header split. The auditable reconstructed list is
`temp/ledger-retirement-candidates.txt`; no new header change is needed.


<a id="li-036"></a>

### LI-036 — Resource capacity rejects already-admitted consumers

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. **Lambda task blocker:** no after repair.
Input owns the resource manager under D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2.

At 500 retained resources, `resource_manager_load` rejected every request before
checking the URL map. CSS, script and image consumers could no longer reuse
already-cached or pending bytes. Conductor's capture exposed this after unrelated
CSS icon prefetch exhausted the budget (Radiant RI-079).

The existing capacity check now follows existing-resource reuse and still
precedes acquisition of every new identity. Document admission still precedes
both paths; the cap remains 500. No caller reference, retry or ownership rule is
changed. The new offline unit actually stores and admits 500 cached identities,
reuses the first as an image consumer, rejects a new 501st URL and checks the
unchanged total. It and two neighboring cache/lifetime units pass.

Evidence: Lambda's `temp/online-visual-round31/input-focused.log`; test
`NetworkResourceManager.CapacityKeepsExistingConsumersAndRejectsNewResources`
in `test/test_network_scheduler_gtest.cpp`. Full input baseline deferred under
the user's focused-verification instruction.

<a id="li-035"></a>

### LI-035 — Grid auto-flow discards pending custom properties

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. **Lambda task blocker:** no after repair.
Input owns declaration validation under D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2.

Ahrefs' saved tablet promotion used `grid-auto-flow:var(--directionTablet-12pdsr3)`
with `column`, but laid out vertically. The `CSS_PROPERTY_GRID_AUTO_FLOW`
validator rejected pending values before the existing Radiant substitution pass.
`css_properties.cpp` now admits pending substitution, as neighboring keyword
properties already do. Substituted values still pass ordinary grammar validation;
an invalid winning variable resets at computed-value time rather than reviving
an older declaration. No page selectors or replacement values are introduced.

Qualification: the new `SupportsGridAutoFlowRetainsPendingSubstitution` case
passes within 32 selected media/supports units. Five exported PNG controls cover
whole-value/list variables, fallback, dense packing and invalid computed values;
all five fail before and pass after, and independently pass Chromium. Evidence:
Lambda's `temp/online-visual-round30/`; tracked reductions are
`test/online/grid_flow_variable_fixtures.cjs` in Lambda. Full input baseline was
deferred under the user's focused-verification instruction.

<a id="li-034"></a>

### LI-034 — Compact logical conditions lose valid token boundaries

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. **Lambda task blocker:** no after repair.
Input owns CSS condition evaluation under D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2.

Ahrefs' minified tablet queries use `(min-width:768px)and (max-width:1279px)`.
`css_condition_find_operator` incorrectly required whitespace before `and`/`or`,
so both device variants painted and the hero lost its tablet width. A closing
parenthesis now supplies that token boundary. Whitespace after the keyword
remains required; `and(` stays a function token rather than a logical operator,
as specified by [Media Queries 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mq-syntax).
The related supports evaluator now unwraps enclosing groups before scanning
operators, fixing nested supported declarations previously sent to the atom parser.

Qualification: two new native cases exercise compact and/or, nesting, case,
comment-separated stylesheet parsing, viewport invalidation and invalid controls.
All 32 selected media/supports cases pass. Six PNG controls improve from 1/6 to
6/6 and independently pass Chromium. The exact saved Ahrefs source removes the
duplicate promotion and restores the hero width. Lambda's
`temp/online-visual-round30/` pins sources/binaries and before/after evidence;
tracked reductions are `test/online/compact_condition_fixtures.cjs` in Lambda.
No admission, URL, stylesheet, viewport or snapshot-time workaround is used.

<a id="li-032"></a>

### LI-032 — Shared signature verifier requires OpenSSL during mbedCrypto-only migration

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-13. The user explicitly authorized scoped
input-owned source, header, tests and build/setup changes for this migration.
**Lambda task blocker:** no; native provider migration and verification complete.
Ownership: D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2; native crypto boundary: D11.1.2.

The previous `lib/signature.c` used OpenSSL EVP/provider APIs and the `lambda-lib`
target required `openssl-crypto`. Replaced the provider with mbedCrypto RSA-PSS/
SHA-256 and P-256/SHA-256 verification. Ed25519 remains an unsupported reserved
ABI value. Raw SEC1 keys require canonical low-S P1363 signatures; SPKI keys use
standard DER ECDSA. PEM/DER parsing rejects trailing data and extra key blocks.
OpenSSL package/link requirements are removed from input build/setup configuration.

Verification: input signature 4/4, digest 9/9, dependency configuration 11/11;
Lambda baseline 7,473/7,473; 85 sync goldens per AUTO/interpreter/JIT; 42 focused
ordinary/forced-GC crypto, identity, TUF and admission checks. Peer, DataChannel
and LAN demo native process gates pass. Native Lambda host and input archive
symbol/linkage audit finds no OpenSSL dependency. Tests retain the external
OpenSSL CLI only as an independent fixture/certificate oracle. Runtime and setup
need no OpenSSL provider. Evidence: Lambda's `temp/mbedcrypto-only/` and its
`vibe/impl/Lambda_Impl_MbedCrypto_Only (done).md` completion record. The user
subsequently authorized the Lambda-owned optional Node provider removal; that
module is also mbedCrypto-only.

<a id="li-030"></a>

### LI-030 — Animated WebP cannot supply even the initial export frame

**Status:** FIXED for initial-frame image decoding, 2026-11-14. Playback and
later-frame selection remain unsupported. **Lambda blocker:** cleared for
Maple 082's missing title. Native ownership **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**;
selected-frame contract **D10.1.7**, allocation ownership **D5.5.1**.

The saved Maple title response is animated WebP despite its `.gif` URL.
The shared decoder explicitly rejected every animated container, including
ordinary image consumers asking only for frame zero. The existing WebP decoder
now decodes the first demuxed subframe directly into a transparent, full-size
canvas, retaining its offset and alpha. ANIM background and later frames are
not composited. The manifest adds the pinned demux source; vendor code is
unchanged. Existing scratch estimates, decoded-pixel and frame limits apply.
Strict thumbnails refuse full-canvas fallback; permitted thumbnails use the
shared reducer. Nonzero frame selection remains explicitly unsupported.

Two new native cases fail before and pass after. They cover full/offset frames,
alpha, transparent canvas, delay/loop metadata, frame/pixel/scratch limits,
truncation, thumbnail policy and unsupported later selection. All five focused
image cases pass, including static scaled WebP, format round trips and GIF.
The unchanged saved Maple page now visibly displays its large Health Yeah title.
Its original Chromium reference shows another animation phase and a cookie
panel; neither page-wide parity nor playback is claimed. Aggregate suites are
deferred under the user's focused-verification instruction.

Evidence: Lambda `temp/online-visual-round26/webp-before.log`, `webp-after.log`,
`maple-before.png` / `maple-after.png`; input `test/test_image_io_gtest.cpp`.
Original source/headers and independent first-frame image remain in Lambda
`temp/online-visual-round24/maple-title*` and `maple-static.html`.


<a id="li-014"></a>

### LI-014 — Native counter value scanning crosses an implicit expression boundary

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Counter scans mark their private end token and expression scanning leaves that boundary for its caller, preventing expansion of following document tokens. Simple, implicit and nested expression controls pass in the native TeX engine suite.


**Status at report:** OPEN — root cause confirmed. **Observed:** 2026-11-11, macOS debug
native TeX parser; independently compared with pdfLaTeX. **Script TeX-port
blocker:** no for implementing the correct bounded evaluation, but native
parity for this case is blocked until the native path is fixed.

For `\begin{document}\newcounter{n}\setcounter{n}{\numexpr1+2}\arabic{n}\end{document}`,
native `parse(..., {type:"tex"})` emits `0` for `\arabic{n}` and reports
`latex-counter-value`, even though the counter eventually holds 3. The
pdfLaTeX reference emits 3; see `temp/expl3-script/counter-numexpr-ref.log` and
`counter-numexpr-debug.out`. In `input-tex-latex.cpp`, `eval_counter_value`
appends one frozen `\relax`, calls `scan_int`, and then reads another expanded
token to check for trailing material. An implicitly terminated `\numexpr`
consumes the only sentinel; that trailing-token read expands the following
`\arabic{n}` before `counter_command` stores the newly computed value. The
counter-value scan must remain bounded to its argument, including nested
expressions, without evaluating the following document tokens prematurely.

### LI-017 — Native TeX leaks an environment end marker inside constructor arguments

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Constructor argument mode executes the internal environment-end primitive and closes the group. The private control name is encoded without consuming the first hex-looking letter. Single and consecutive custom-environment controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN — cause confirmed for the observed path. **Observed:**
2026-11-12, macOS debug native TeX parser. **Script TeX-port blocker:** yes for
native-compatible handling of custom environments inside constructor arguments.

For `\newenvironment{foo}{B}{E}\begin{document}\textbf{A\begin{foo}X\end{foo}Z}\end{document}`,
native TeX output contains `\textbf{ABXE\.nvendZ}`. The reproduction and
native output are in `temp/expl3-script/constructor-env-probe.ls` and `.out`;
the staged Script result explicitly fails reconstruction for this case. In
`lambda/input/input-tex-latex.cpp`, `latex_arg_mode_env` pushes the end macro
and the internal environment-end primitive for a custom environment.
`arg_mode` in `lambda/input/input-tex-main.cpp` emits that unexpandable
primitive instead of executing it, leaking its internal control sequence into
the output and leaving the environment group unclosed. The internal name uses
`"\x02envend"`, whose C++ hexadecimal escape includes the `e` and produces
the observed leading dot. The native argument-mode handling and group lifetime
need correction before this case can be used as a parity reference.

### LI-018 — Native LaTeX environment scanning interprets raw inline verbatim

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The document environment scanner shares the existing verbatim delimiter scanner, so percent signs and environment-looking text inside verb payloads remain raw. The original and starred reproductions pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN — cause confirmed for the observed examples. **Observed:**
2026-11-12, macOS debug native LaTeX parser. **Script TeX-port blocker:** yes
for native AST comparison of affected valid verbatim content.

Native TeX preserves both `\begin{document}A\verb|x_%|B\end{document}` and
`\begin{document}A\verb|\end{document}|B\end{document}` without diagnostics,
but native LaTeX parsing reports an error for each; the same parser builds a
`verb` node for `\verb|xyz|`. Reproduction and output are
`temp/expl3-script/verb-native-digest-probe.ls` and `.out`. The document
`find_environment_end` scan in `lambda/input/input-latex-c.cpp` skips the
control word but does not skip its verbatim payload, so it treats `%` inside
that payload as a comment and `\end{document}` inside it as an environment
terminator. The scan needs to recognize raw inline spans before looking for
comments and environment boundaries.

<a id="li-019"></a>

### LI-019 — Native TeX discard boundaries become stale after cross-boundary unskip

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Removing a preceding space now adjusts all open output-slice boundaries before nested boxes finish. The original discard and global-definition controls pass without leaked content or an out-of-bounds removal.


**Status at report:** OPEN — root cause confirmed. **Observed:** 2026-11-12, macOS debug
native TeX parser. **Script TeX-port blocker:** yes for native-compatible
cross-boundary removal in discarded and nested box material.

For `\begin{document}A \insert0{\vadjust{\unskip}X}B\end{document}`, native
TeX emits `AXB`: the inner `\unskip` removes the preceding space, but `X`
leaks from the outer discarded insert. A similar case leaks an echoed global
macro definition. Reproduction and native output are
`temp/expl3-script/discard-unskip-detail.ls` and `.out`. The native log also
shows `arraylist_remove_oob` with a length of 4294967295; evidence is
`temp/expl3-script/discard-unskip-detail.log`.

`unskip` in `lambda/input/input-tex-main.cpp` removes the last output item
without adjusting open groups' `out_start` values. `finish_box` in
`lambda/input/input-tex-prims.cpp` subtracts those stale unsigned boundaries
from the shorter output length; it can either leave subsequent items outside
the intended discard slice or underflow. The array-list bounds check rejects
the invalid removal. Update the native boundary accounting and qualify nested
discarded groups before using these cases as port parity references.

<a id="li-029"></a>

### LI-029 — Deferred single-block width is omitted from a parsed style rule

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Width and height validation now defers its single-value grammar when substitution is pending. The original nested stylesheet and standalone declaration pass, while non-variable block and extra-token controls remain rejected.


**Status at report:** OPEN observed discrepancy; source cause **unconfirmed**, 2026-11-13.
**Lambda blocker:** no for LI-028's nested-selector repair. Ownership
**D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**, parsed declaration ownership **D5.5.1**.

For `.outer{--tokens:{a:hover{width:1px}};width:{var(--size)};a:hover{color:green}.tail{height:2px}}`,
Chromium retains two declarations on the outer style, including the deferred
single-block width. The native engine parser reports only one outer declaration
before LI-028. This is distinct from losing the following pseudo/nested rules.
The declaration parser already has a `css_value_is_single_var_block` path and
focused color-block tests; the stage that drops this width is not yet isolated.
No blanket acceptance or test masking is added. LI-028's custom-block control
uses a supported definite width to test its selected nesting contract.
Evidence: Lambda `temp/online-visual-round18/parser-before.log` and
`browser-controls.json`/`.log`; no current-source resolution claim is made.


<a id="li-005"></a>

### LI-005 — Boundary check looks in the unprofiled object directory

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The boundary audit now receives the selected build profile and reads its dependency files. Debug and release audits pass; stale unprofiled files no longer affect the result.


**Status at report:** OPEN — build validation failure. **Observed:** 2026-11-10, macOS,
`make -j4 check-boundary` (debug). **Lambda blocker:** not established.
Authority: **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2** (input ownership boundary).

The input archives build, but `scripts/check_boundary.py` reports missing
dependency files because it checks `build/obj/<group>/<source>.o.d`, while the
Makefile writes them under `build/obj/<group>/<profile>/<source>.o.d`. The
expected result is for `make check-boundary` to inspect the selected profile's
dependency files and succeed when all dependencies stay inside input. An
in-memory audit using the debug-profile paths passed during LI-004 verification.

<a id="li-012"></a>

### LI-012 — Native tar variants test rejects sample.tar.gz

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The macOS native test link now places zlib before the JPEG provider, whose exported inflate symbols otherwise intercept gzip initialization. The executable binds inflateInit2_ to libz and all 35 archive cases pass, including compressed tar integrity and limits. Other hosts must likewise link the intended zlib provider.


**Status at report:** OPEN — cause unconfirmed. **Observed:** 2026-11-11, macOS,
`make test-input-baseline` (debug), including a rerun with local socket access.
**Lambda blocker:** no known block to the independent TeX script port. Ownership:
**D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**.

Input base `c5ca83e6d4d9793223117398cea5caea868d1040` plus the two-line HTTP POST
repair fails `ZipTest.NativeTarVariantsCaptureExactBytesAndNames` at
`test/test_zip_gtest.cpp:602`: opening `test/input/archive/sample.tar.gz` returns
null with `tar: invalid or unsupported archive`. The uncompressed tar fixture
succeeds; the gzip variant is expected to preserve the same entries and bytes.
The archive suite reports 34/35 passing, and a focused rerun reproduces the
failure in 2 ms. A separate baseline and rerun with local socket access report
the same failure, with the other 34 cases passing. No archive source, fixture,
expectation, or vendor dependency was edited for these observations.

Reproduce from input:

```sh
./build/test/test_zip_gtest --gtest_filter=ZipTest.NativeTarVariantsCaptureExactBytesAndNames
```

Evidence: `../../lambda/temp/kianhup-hang/input-baseline.log` and
`tar-control.log`. Existing LI-001 / LI-002 also fail the input aggregate;
all seven local HTTP cases and the Lambda viewer gate pass. No archive repair
or confirmed regression attribution is claimed.

<a id="li-031"></a>

### LI-031 — Unclosed optional math argument stalls native LaTeX parsing

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The fallback command parser leaves an unmatched bracket for punctuation parsing instead of retrying without advancing. The native unclosed-argument regression terminates successfully.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 with the local macOS Lambda snapshot.
**Lambda task blocker:** yes for malformed-input parity and safe full script
port qualification. D10.2.2 governs the current LaTeX input boundary.

Parsing `\begin{document}$\downarrow[unclosed$\end{document}` with
`parse(..., {type: "latex"})` did not return within five seconds; the timed
process was stopped. The fallback loop in `lambda/input/input-latex-c.cpp`
sees `[`, calls `parse_brack_group`, and repeats without advancing when the
bracket is unclosed: `consume_group_span` returns false for that form.
Parsing should terminate with a recoverable result or a diagnostic.

Reproduce with `python3 temp/expl3-script/verify-native-unclosed-math-bracket.py`;
the script and `native-unclosed-math-bracket-result.txt` are in the same
temporary directory. The behavior was discovered while qualifying the Lambda
Script TeX engine. Native input ownership is unchanged, and no input source
or reference result is modified by this report.

<a id="li-033"></a>

### LI-033 — Escaped dollar ends native inline math prematurely

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Dollar-delimited math skips escaped control symbols when searching for its closing delimiter. The escaped-dollar regression and neighboring native LaTeX cases pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 with the local macOS Lambda snapshot.
**Lambda task blocker:** yes for native-reference comparison of dollar-delimited
math containing an escaped dollar; other math cases can proceed. D10.2.2
governs the current LaTeX input boundary.

Parsing `\begin{document}$\$\%\#$\end{document}` with
`parse(..., {type: "latex"})` reports a missing dollar delimiter, although
the escaped dollar belongs to the math content. The dollar-math delimiter
scan in `lambda/input/input-latex-c.cpp` stops at the first `$` byte without
checking whether it is escaped. The expected result is one closed math node
containing the escaped symbols.

Reproduction and error evidence are in
`temp/expl3-script/math-raw-probe.ls` and `math-raw-v4-interp.log`. The issue
was found while qualifying the Lambda Script TeX engine. Native input source
and existing reference results have not been modified for this report.

<a id="li-037"></a>

### LI-037 — JSON top-level parser accepts trailing non-whitespace

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The script-facing JSON parser now rejects missing top-level values and non-whitespace trailing content using the existing parse-error channel. Focused valid and invalid controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 on macOS with Lambda-opus debug
`8b5ebe56e` plus the editor work. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for safely
admitting JSON property editing. Input ownership follows **D9.1.1v4**;
**S7.5.1v6** governs acknowledgement of an ordinary parse error.

From the Lambda checkout, run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/invalid.ls`
(the script evaluates `parse` on malformed JSON). In particular,
`parse("1abc", 'json')` and `parse("1 2", 'json')` both return `1`
instead of reporting the non-whitespace content after the top-level value;
`parse("", 'json')` returns null. Malformed JSON must report an error rather
than admit a prefix as the complete document. The editor cannot trust the
script-facing result when checking whether a JSON file or edited value is
safe to save.

In `lambda/input/input-json.cpp`, `parse_json` calls `parse_value` once and
returns without checking the remaining cursor; the existing native
`parse_json_to_item_strict` has a trailing-content check. The script-facing
`parse(..., 'json')` dispatch and the intended strictness policy should be
confirmed by the input owner. This report does not change input sources or
reference results.

<a id="li-038"></a>

### LI-038 — TOML parser accepts a numeric prefix followed by invalid text

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. TOML document parsing validates the remainder of each value line before accepting the value. Numeric-prefix and extra-token regressions pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 on macOS with the Lambda-opus
`8b5ebe56e` debug snapshot plus editor work. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for
safe property editing of the affected format. Input ownership follows
**D9.1.1v4**; **S7.5.1v6** governs acknowledgement of a parse error.

`parse("x = 1junk\n", 'toml')` returns `{x: 1}` instead of rejecting the invalid numeric value. The editor cannot use that result to validate property edits or saved data. Relevant owner code is `lambda/input/input-toml.cpp`; the exact cause has not been confirmed.

Reproduce from the Lambda checkout with `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/other-invalid.ls`.
A malformed document must produce an error rather than a successful partial
value. No input implementation or reference was changed by this report.

<a id="li-039"></a>

### LI-039 — YAML parser accepts an unterminated flow sequence

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Flow sequences and mappings now require their matching closing delimiter. Focused malformed cases and the existing YAML corpus pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 on macOS with the Lambda-opus
`8b5ebe56e` debug snapshot plus editor work. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for
safe property editing of the affected format. Input ownership follows
**D9.1.1v4**; **S7.5.1v6** governs acknowledgement of a parse error.

`parse("a: [1,\n", 'yaml')` returns a map containing `a: [1]` rather than an error for the unclosed sequence. The editor cannot rely on this parser to validate the complete YAML document. Relevant owner code is `lambda/input/input-yaml.cpp`; the exact cause has not been confirmed.

Reproduce from the Lambda checkout with `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/other-invalid.ls`.
A malformed document must produce an error rather than a successful partial
value. No input implementation or reference was changed by this report.

<a id="li-040"></a>

### LI-040 — iCalendar and vCard parsers silently drop malformed content lines

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Calendar and contact readers report content lines missing a property name or value separator instead of silently discarding them. Focused malformed-line controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 on macOS with the Lambda-opus
`8b5ebe56e` debug snapshot plus editor work. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for
safe property editing of the affected format. Input ownership follows
**D9.1.1v4**; **S7.5.1v6** governs acknowledgement of a parse error.

Both `parse("BEGIN:VCALENDAR\nBROKEN\nEND:VCALENDAR\n", 'ics')` and `parse("BEGIN:VCARD\nBROKEN\nEND:VCARD\n", 'vcf')` succeed with empty entries, instead of reporting the line without a colon. The editor cannot rely on these results to validate a complete contact or calendar file. Relevant owner code is `lambda/input/input-ics.cpp` and `lambda/input/input-vcf.cpp`; the exact causes have not been confirmed. This is consistent with the older I-F10 observation in `vibe/impl/Lambda_Impl_Code_Review.md`.

Reproduce from the Lambda checkout with `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/other-invalid.ls`.
A malformed document must produce an error rather than a successful partial
value. No input implementation or reference was changed by this report.

<a id="li-041"></a>

### LI-041 — Markdown footnote definitions lack source ranges

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. With source positions requested, each Markdown footnote retains its authored range, and duplicate definitions remain available as separate source-backed nodes without changing ordinary reference resolution. Multiline, unused, and duplicate-definition controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 on macOS with the Lambda-opus
`8b5ebe56e` debug snapshot plus editor work. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for
showing and editing surrounding Markdown while retaining footnote definitions
as individually rendered view-only blocks. Input ownership follows **D9.1.1v4**;
source-backed document editing is covered by **D9.3.4**.

`parse(source, {type: 'markdown', sourcepos: true})` gives authored paragraph,
HTML and math blocks `sourcepos`, but moves footnote definitions into a generated
`<footnotes>` element whose individual `<footnote>` nodes have no original
source positions. The original source may contain multiple definitions and
unrelated link definitions in the same gap. Consequently the Lambda editor
cannot reliably associate each footnote with its exact authored lines, and
shows the combined gap as raw source instead of rendering the footnote. The
existing `edit_md_view_only` and `edit_md_view_only_keys` UI replays reproduce
this with the original editor as well as the current changes.

Reproduce from the Lambda checkout with
`./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/md-footnote-probe.ls` using
`test/ui/edit/kept.md`; its output shows the source-positioned body nodes,
the generated footnote without a `sourcepos`, and the combined source gap.
`lambda/input/markup/block/block_document.cpp` records source positions for
ordinary blocks but `parseFootnoteDefinition` constructs the note separately.
The input owner should retain each definition's original span when source
positions are requested, including multiline, duplicate and unused definitions.
No input implementation or reference was changed by this report.

<a id="li-042"></a>

### LI-042 — CSV separator detection counts tabs inside quoted fields

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Separator detection scans the first logical record, ignoring separators and line breaks within quoted fields and handling doubled quotes. Focused detection and parsed-row controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN, reproduced 2026-11-13 on macOS with the Lambda-opus
`8b5ebe56e` debug snapshot plus editor work. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for
property editing CSV files whose first quoted record contains more tabs than
commas. Input ownership follows **D9.1.1v4**; **D9.3.4** covers document
processing.

`parse("\"a\t\tb\",c\n1,2\n", 'csv')` treats tabs inside the
quoted first field as separators and returns one field named `a\t\tb`
with value `1,2`, instead of the two CSV columns `a\t\tb` and `c`
with values `1` and `2`. The viewer uses this input parser. The editor's
matching delimiter choice cannot safely build the property tree for this
source and currently falls back to source editing.

Reproduce from the Lambda checkout with
`./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/csv-separator-probe.ls`. In
`lambda/input/input-csv.cpp`, `detect_csv_separator` counts every tab and
comma on the first physical line without tracking quoted fields. Detection
should ignore delimiters inside quoted fields, including escaped quotes and
multiline quoted records. No input implementation or reference was changed
by this report.

<a id="li-043"></a>

### LI-043 — Man parser renders the zero-width `\&` escape as text

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The man inline reader consumes the roff zero-width escape without producing visible text. The focused man regression passes.


**Status at report:** Open. **Blocks:** rich editing of man pages in `lambda edit`.

Reproduction from the Lambda checkout: run a Lambda script evaluating
`parse(".SH NAME\n\\&test\n", 'man')` and
`parse(".SH NAME\ntest\n", 'man')`. The first result contains a span with
text `&test`; the second contains text `test`. The roff `\&` escape is
zero-width, so these inputs should have the same visible paragraph text.
The checked output is in `Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/man-input-probe.log`.
The parser's treatment of this escape is unconfirmed; this report identifies
observable behavior rather than an implementation cause. The Lambda man writer
uses `\&` to protect text, so its output cannot currently round-trip through
the input parser. The editor retains source mode until the input owner fixes it.

<a id="li-045"></a>

### LI-045 — Textile formatter and parser disagree on ordinary spans

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Explicit Textile input now selects the Textile adapter, and its inline parser reads the span delimiters emitted by the existing writer. The writer assertion and parse-format-parse control pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for rich editing of Textile
paragraphs whose parsed model contains a span. D9.3.4 governs document processing.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/markup-roundtrip-probe.ls`.
The Textile input `h1. Title\n\nHello _world_.\n` parses with paragraph text
`Hello `, an emphasized `world`, and `.`. Formatting its Markdown-equivalent
Mark Doc to Textile produces `h1. Title\n\n%Hello _world_.%\n\n`.
Reparsing that output includes the surrounding `%` characters as visible text.
The input-owned Textile formatter's custom `span` handler emits `%` delimiters;
whether the formatter or parser should change is not yet confirmed. The editor
cannot save this round trip without changing visible text and falls back to source.
Evidence: `Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/markup-roundtrip-probe.log`.

<a id="li-046"></a>

### LI-046 — Org table and source block round trips lose structure

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. Org input recognizes plus-delimited table separators; its writer accepts shared table nodes and writes language-free block code as a source block. Focused parsing and format-then-parse controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for rich editing of affected
Org tables and source blocks. D9.3.4 governs document processing.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/markup-structure-roundtrip.ls`.
The Org input `| A | B |\n|---+---|\n| one | two |\n` is parsed with the
separator as a data row; after Markdown conversion the input-owned Org writer
returns an empty string. The source block `#+BEGIN_SRC\nhello\n#+END_SRC\n`
parses as block code, but formatting its Markdown-equivalent model produces
`~hello\n~`, which reparses as ordinary paragraph text. The responsible parser
and formatter paths are input-owned; the exact causes remain unconfirmed. The
editor falls back to source instead of losing table or code structure. Evidence:
`Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/markup-structure-roundtrip.log`.

<a id="li-047"></a>

### LI-047 — reStructuredText literal block changes content on round trip

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The RST literal-block reader saves its introduction before reusing the parser buffer, and the formatter emits block code as raw indented directive content. Literal-block and multiline-code format-then-parse controls pass.


**Status at report:** OPEN. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for rich editing of affected
RST literal blocks. D9.3.4 governs document processing.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/markup-structure-roundtrip.ls`.
For `Example::\n\n  code\n`, the input parser returns a div with a
paragraph `code` and a pre/code block also containing `code`; the `Example:`
introduction is absent. Formatting its Markdown-equivalent Mark Doc back to
RST yields a paragraph and inline-code syntax, which reparses to a different
model. The input parser and formatter are both input-owned; the exact root
causes have not been confirmed. The editor falls back to source to avoid
changing the document. Evidence:
`Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/markup-structure-roundtrip.log`.

<a id="li-048"></a>

### LI-048 — Org writer merges a following paragraph into a list

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The Org writer emits a blank line after a top-level list, preserving a following paragraph on reparse. The focused structural round trip passes.


**Status at report:** OPEN. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for rich editing of Org files
with a list followed by a paragraph. D9.3.4 governs document processing.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/org-combined-probe.ls`.
The source in `test/ui/edit/sample-org-list-followed.org` contains a two-item list followed
by a separate paragraph with a link. The input-owned Org formatter emits the
list and paragraph without a separating blank line, and reparsing places the
paragraph inside the second list item. The editor falls back to source rather
than changing the document structure. The precise formatter cause is not yet
confirmed. Evidence: `Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/org-combined-probe.log`.

<a id="li-049"></a>

### LI-049 — Org parser treats slash emphasis as plain text

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The inline prefilter recognizes Org-only emphasis markers before choosing the plain-text fast path. Slash emphasis and neighboring markers pass focused tests.


**Status at report:** OPEN. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for rendering and rich editing
of Org italic text. D9.3.4 governs document processing.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/org-combine-census.ls`.
Both `Hello /world/.\n` and `/world/\n` parse as plain paragraph strings
containing the slash delimiters instead of an emphasized run. The viewer and
editor both consume this input-owned parse result. The exact cause is not yet
confirmed. Evidence: `Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/org-combine-census.log`.

<a id="li-051"></a>

### LI-051 — Properties parser treats escaped key separators as delimiters

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. The properties reader decodes escaped key separators, whitespace, and continued key lines before splitting the entry. Focused input tests pass. The separately owned Lambda editor source-span scanner still needs its own repair, recorded in the [Lambda ledger](../../Lambda/vibe/Lambda_Issue_Ledger.md#input-format-integration-handoffs--2026-11-14).

The properties escape adapter also preserves Java's literal `b` for `\b` in
keys and values, instead of applying the shared JSON backspace rule. The
extended key/value regression reproduced the difference before the repair.


**Status at report:** OPEN. **Lambda task blocker:** yes for correct property editing of
Java properties with escaped key separators or spaces. D9.3.4 governs document
processing.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/property-escape-probe.ls`.
For `a\=b=c`, parsing as `properties` currently returns key `a\` and value
`b=c`; Java's `Properties.load(Reader)` rules specify key `a=b` and value `c`.
The editor's current source-span scanner makes the same split and thus presents
this file incorrectly. A separate probe of `key\ space=value` produces a parse
error. The Input implementation cause is unconfirmed. Once the Input provider
is corrected, the Lambda editor's span scanner also needs to recognize escaped
separators and preserve their spelling; do not patch around the Input parser.
Evidence: `Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/property-escape-probe.log`. Reference:
[Java Properties.load documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)).

### LI-050 — Markdown parser drops trailing spaces inside link labels

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-14. **Lambda task blocker:** cleared for link-label
whitespace and `editor_markdown_link_roundtrip`. D9.3.4 governs document
processing; D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2 assign the parser repair to Input. The user
explicitly authorized the owner-side repair after the initial boundary report.
Implementation and complete verification:
[Markdown link-label whitespace](<impl/Lib_Input_Impl_Markdown_Link_Whitespace (done).md>).

The parser now applies paragraph-ending space removal only outside the existing
link-label context, in both the plain and mixed-content paths. Nine label cases
reproduce the defect before the fix; all 77 modular markup tests and 1,337
CommonMark examples pass afterward. Lambda's 97 editor tests and full 7,509-test
baseline pass. The Input aggregate retains its separately recorded LI-001,
LI-002 and LI-012 failures (5,235 passed, three failed, one skipped).

The following records the original reproduction and diagnosis before repair.

From the Lambda checkout run `./lambda.exe temp/edit-viewer/md-link-label-probe.ls`.
Parsing `[ leading and trailing ](https://example.org)` yields an `<a>` whose
text is ` leading and trailing`, missing the trailing space; formatting that
model confirms the lost space. The Markdown source spells the trailing space
inside the link and it is visible before adjacent text. The editor's rich
link command can produce this valid source when a selection ends in a space;
its preservation check must refuse the save while reparsing changes the model.
Earlier evidence: `Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/md-link-label-probe.log` and
`Lambda-opus/temp/edit-viewer/link-model-new.log`.

**Confirmed pre-fix cause:** `lambda/input/markup/inline/inline_link.cpp:604` passes the
label to `parse_inline_spans` with `parser->state.link_depth` incremented.
That parser applies paragraph-ending space removal to nested link content:
its plain-string path at `inline/inline_spans.cpp:151` trims the label, and
the mixed-content flush at `inline/inline_spans.cpp:676` does the same.
The missing distinction is paragraph-ending versus nested-inline whitespace;
this belongs in the Input parser, with coverage for both paths.

**Pre-fix reproduction:** Lambda `9bf2203cd2277dac94e5b1c9310bf84f43107eb3`,
existing debug host, AUTO tier, 2026-11-14:
`./test/test_lambda_gtest.exe --gtest_filter='AutoDiscovered/LambdaScriptTest.ExecuteAndCompare/editor_markdown_link_roundtrip'`
returns `[false, false, true, true]` instead of `[true, true, true, true]`.
Run `./lambda.exe temp/failed-dom-editor-tests/link-probe.ls` from Lambda to
inspect the original and reparsed models: the selection is `short paragraph `,
the exported link is `[short paragraph ](https://example.org)`, and reimport
changes its label to `short paragraph`. The round-trip guard correctly rejects
the changed paragraph. Evidence: Lambda
[`link-repro.log`](../../lambda/temp/failed-dom-editor-tests/link-repro.log),
[`link-probe.ls`](../../lambda/temp/failed-dom-editor-tests/link-probe.ls) and
[`link-probe.log`](../../lambda/temp/failed-dom-editor-tests/link-probe.log).
The initial Lambda task stopped at the ownership boundary. After explicit
authorization, the Input repair cleared the blocker while retaining the golden
and whitespace-preservation guard.

### LI-028 — Type-prefixed nested pseudo selectors consume following rules

**Status:** FIXED, 2026-11-13; fresh online captures are running. **Lambda blocker:** the reduced DigitalOcean
hero omission is repaired. Ownership **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**, parsed source and
scratch **D5.5.1**, selected export frame **D10.1.7** unchanged.

DigitalOcean's authored `html[data-pdocs=home]` rule includes `body::before`
before its home hero/media styles. `css_parser.cpp` treated any IDENT followed
by COLON as a declaration in both style and nested conditional blocks. Thus
`a:hover`, `p::before` and functional pseudo selectors consumed their blocks
as malformed declarations, losing later nested rules. The saved script-free
HTML/CSS and small type-pseudo controls reproduce it; explicit `&` and plain
type selector controls work. CSS Syntax3§5.5.5/§5.5.6 requires a failed
declaration to be reconsidered as a qualified rule.

One shared `css_nested_item_starts_rule` helper now disambiguates a top-level
rule block while retaining custom-property component blocks, single-block
values, function/bracket contexts and semicolon recovery. Both parsing
contexts reuse it; no authored CSS or selector is rewritten. The known-property
names `font:hover` and `color:is(.active)` are covered too.

The complete114-case native parser suite passes, including two new cases with
16 selector/context variants and a custom-block control. Twenty real PNG cases
improve2/20 to20/20; independent Chromium agrees on all20. Identical saved
DigitalOcean HTML/CSS with scripts removed now restores the lighthouse image,
paragraph width and hero spacing. Original online references remain fixed;
independent cookie/navigation/background differences are not claimed repaired.
111 online CLI/capture/comparator checks and17 recorded layout suites pass:
630 JS layouts,4979 static passes,295 recorded partials,zero regressions/skips.
Full Input aggregate records5223passes,one skip and the same independent
GraphParserTest.ParserLocBudget, TransitionTreeExternalParentTest.InadmissibleParentsAreDeclined,
and ZipTest.NativeTarVariantsCaptureExactBytesAndNames failures (LI-001 /
LI-002 / LI-012). Those sources/fixtures are unchanged; the complete aggregate
is not called green. Live nested-rule mutation and CSSOM identity add74 UI
assertions with the pinned host.

Evidence: Lambda `temp/online-visual-round18/`: `parser-before.log`,
`parser-after.log`, `png-before.log`, `png-after.log`, `browser-controls.json`,
`digitalocean-{before,after}.png`, frozen HTML/CSS and `layout-results.json`.
Host SHA256 `2119303b51366ffd876710921373c88ea244d4cfe84f159572136e6cd1fe37fc`
uses Lambda0c5c0ba0d / Radiant eb39862 plus RI-062 / Input4d1ad20 plus this
parser repair. An initial native custom-block test also exposed an unrelated
single-block width retention discrepancy; its control uses a definite width
to isolate nesting, and that discrepancy is not claimed fixed.


<a id="li-025"></a>

### LI-025 — Cookie domains include URL ports

**Status:** FIXED, 2026-11-12. **Lambda blocker:** cleared for cookie transport.
Ownership **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**. Cookie host extraction reads Url.host, which
contains a nondefault port, instead of the canonical hostname. Cookies then
fail matching on another port of the same host, and curl rejects their imported
port-bearing domain for subresource requests. [RFC6265 §8.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6265/#section-8.5)
does not isolate cookies by port.

Use url_get_hostname, retaining the established empty-authority behavior for
hostless file documents. CookiesShareAHostnameAcrossPorts fails before and
passes after; a distinct hostname still receives no cookie. The added
FileDocumentCookiesRetainTheirEmptyHostname and existing JS dom_document_cookie
golden protect file compatibility. Initial and script-created image requests
in the real HTTP export tests now carry the shared response/DOM cookies.
The three new input cases are included in the local baseline filter.

Final input aggregate:5224 passes,1 skip, with the same independent graph LOC
budget, transition-tree external-parent and sample.tar.gz failures (LI-001 /
LI-002 / LI-012). No affected source or fixture for those failures changed.
Full AST574 and real HTTP/session6 checks pass with native services available.
Evidence in Lambda temp/online-visual-round8/: http-before.log,
http-hostless.log, input-baseline-final.log, session-qualified.log,
js-baseline-ast-qualified.log. Capture qualification is in Lambda
 test/online/README.md; native RI-045 provides the missing export profile.

<a id="li-024"></a>

### LI-024 — Document response cookies retain HTTP line terminators

**Status:** FIXED, 2026-11-12. **Lambda blocker:** cleared for the reduced
export-session case. Ownership **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**. The synchronous document
header callback copies the full curl span into cookie_jar_store. Unlike the
other network frontends, it leaves CRLF intact. A final Path=/ then contains
line endings and fails matching; a terminal HttpOnly/Secure name fails the
attribute comparison. The two-cookie local response exposes the private cookie
to document.cookie while omitting the ordinary visible cookie.
[libcurl HEADERFUNCTION](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION.html)
delivers bounded, non-NUL-terminated header lines including their terminator.

Use one cookie_jar_store_response_header helper to normalize the bounded span
and store the copied value. The document, synchronous-resource and curl-multi
callbacks reuse it, replacing duplicate normalization code. Allocation failure
aborts the transport. No vendored curl implementation is changed.
DocumentCookiesKeepFinalPathAndHttpOnlyAttributes fails before and passes after;
script-visible cookies exclude HttpOnly while request cookies include it.
All ten local HTTP cases and six real-renderer session tests pass. Evidence:
Lambda temp/online-visual-round8/{http-before.log,http-after.log,http-hostless.log,
session-qualified.log}. The full input gate retains the independent LI-001,
LI-002 and LI-012 failures; expectations and filters were not weakened.

<a id="li-023"></a>

### LI-023 — Missing Oklab/OkLCh components invalidate neutral theme colors

**Status:** FIXED, 2026-11-12. Input color computation ownership follows
**D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.2v2**. **Lambda blocker:** cleared for the reduced theme case.
Nuxt uses `oklch(14.5% 0 none)` in its neutral palette. The shared color helper
already retains a missing-channel bit and a zero used value, but the caller
explicitly disallowed missing components for perceptual functions. This
invalidated the palette fallback, leaving the dark page background transparent
and white headings invisible. CSS Color 4 §4.4 permits `none` in modern color
syntax and treats missing components as zero outside interpolation.

The caller now admits missing channels through the existing helper. Six
regression cases cover lightness/chroma/hue/alpha, stored missing bits,
serialization, round trips and RGB consumers. Two formerly-invalid assertions
were corrected to test actually invalid identifiers instead. The Nuxt hue
case fails before the change; all 112 CSS parser tests pass after. This does
not implement missing-component interpolation in color-mix or new color spaces.
Evidence: Lambda `temp/online-visual-round3/` reduced pages, `color-tests.log`
and Nuxt captures. The report must retain unrelated icon/mask limitations.

### LI-021 — All-frame GIF decoding bypasses the process memory budget

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-11. **Lambda task blocker:** cleared for Studio
PNG capture. Ownership **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.2v2 / D9.1.3v2**. Sibling updates
were explicitly authorized by the user.

`image_gif_load_from_memory` checked each container against its decoded-byte
limit but allocated all composited frames without process admission. Several
individually valid animations on `https://studio.design/` retained
1,059,694,508 image-category bytes, preventing a viewport PNG allocation.
An allocation stack identifies `image_gif_load_from_memory` during intrinsic
image measurement. The existing preflight peak estimate is now returned and
admitted through `memtrack_allow_allocation` before giflib expansion. Structured
later-frame decoding reports `IMAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` when admission fails.
The process limit is unchanged; independent first-frame decoding remains
available when the complete animation cannot fit.

Full image I/O passes 35/35, including palette/disposal/loop behavior, budget
rejection and still decoding; native Radiant GIF playback passes 23/23.
Studio now exports with 711,756,076 image-category bytes. Its selected initial
frame is mostly blank, so this is load/export qualification, not visual parity.
Evidence: Lambda `temp/online-recovery/studio-image-trace3-output.log`,
`studio-budget-fixed-output.log`, and canonical Studio capture; owner
`temp/online-gif-tests.log`; Radiant `temp/online-gif-player-tests.log`.

Coordinated Lambda **LR03-46** also reuses `map_put_heap` for private JS fields.
The input builder now grows storage before publishing its new descriptor,
preserving **D6.3** at its collecting growth callback. The callback sees the
complete old field list until the added lane and value exist. Lambda's forced-GC private growth regression passes; its full core gate passes
7,415/7,415 including 859 JS, 368 GC stress and 47 representation cases.
Qualification is recorded under Lambda LR03-46 and its final test logs.

<a id="li-020"></a>

### LI-020 — Empty POST reads terminal stdin and blocks page initialization

**Status:** RESOLVED, 2026-11-11.
**Lambda blocker:** removed; the plain terminal launch now renders the login form.
Owner authority: **D9.1.2v2**, **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**. The user explicitly
authorized the owner-side fix on 2026-11-11 after the original boundary report.

Confirmed on input `c5ca83e6d4d9793223117398cea5caea868d1040` and Lambda
`456ba137dfe84a19eb59ef8c48f602fac7ffce28` plus its pending cookie-capability
repair. Plain interactive startup hangs before first layout. The public page's
Acro script performs synchronous template POST requests with no body.
`http_fetch2()` sets `CURLOPT_POST=1`, but `http_set_request_body()` returns
without setting a body or length when `FetchConfig.body` is null. Curl then
uses its default stdin reader. The main-thread sample shows
`js_xhr_send -> http_fetch2 -> curl_easy_perform -> Curl_client_read -> fread
-> __read_nocancel`. The process remains idle, waiting for terminal input;
the network timeout and CPU watchdog do not interrupt that blocking read.

Earlier automated runs had EOF on stdin and completed, hiding this separate
failure after Lambda's missing `navigator.cookieEnabled` was fixed. The
[curl POSTFIELDS contract](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS.html)
requires an explicit empty buffer or zero POST length for an empty request.

Evidence: `../../lambda/temp/kianhup-hang/user-hang.log` and
`user-process.sample.txt`, captured from the user's process PID 53623 without
changing or terminating it. Reproduction: run the exact `view` command in a
terminal with stdin open. A regression must keep stdin open rather than rely
on subprocess EOF. Repair: set POST's initial length to zero, then let the
existing optional-body helper supply an explicit payload and length. No
vendor curl patch or Lambda-side workaround is needed.

**Repair and verification:** `lambda/input/input_http.cpp` `http_fetch2()`
now sets POST's initial length to zero before `http_set_request_body()`
applies any explicit payload. `test/test_http_gtest.cpp`
`EmptyPostDoesNotReadStdin` covers null and empty bodies with a pipe whose
writer remains open, and is selected by the owner offline baseline filter.
All seven local HTTP tests pass. Lambda's rebuilt debug host reaches first
render with live PTY stdin and the exact viewer argv, then a windowed PTY
replay confirms the complete form (`plain-pty.out`, `plain-pty.log`,
`login-window.png`, `login-window.log`). The viewer integration baseline
passes: 8,161 passed, 299 partial, 20 skipped of 8,480, zero failures
(`radiant-baseline.log`). The broader input baseline still fails LI-001,
LI-002 and the separately recorded LI-012; its HTTP cases all pass. Evidence
and the completion checkpoint are under `../../lambda/temp/kianhup-hang/`.
No credentials were entered or login submitted.

### LI-016 — Combined cloud/peer agent stalls during input/lib teardown

**Status:** RESOLVED — owner fix and combined-agent qualification complete (2026-11-12).
The user explicitly authorized `lambda-input` source changes for this issue.

**Confirmed cause:** InputManager releases retained Inputs in creation order.
Each Input's context was pushed onto a singly linked newest-first sibling list;
`detach_from_parent_locked` scanned that list to remove each oldest context.
The resulting quadratic pointer traversal dominated process exit. The stall was
not evidence of a graph cycle or skipped allocator destruction.

`MemContext` now retains a private previous-sibling link. Creation and removal
maintain both links under the existing registry lock, making arbitrary detach
constant time. Cleanup order and backing dependency teardown remain unchanged
(D5.2.1, D5.2.5). A mixed-order lifecycle test checks survivors, head/middle/tail
removal, reinsertion and final cascade destruction.

Release reproduction (`-O3 -DNDEBUG -std=c17`) compiles the exact before/after
source and exercises the same input-order topology. For 80,000 contexts, full
creation/destruction changed from about 3.03 seconds to a median 0.0097 seconds;
this is an isolated lifecycle measurement, not application-throughput evidence.
Owner focused suites pass **18 memory-context + 7 factory + 62 pool = 87 tests**.
Lambda's rebuilt native host passes **17/17 real-S3 cloud/combined-agent checks
on interpreter, AUTO and JIT**, with the original 180-second deadline unchanged.
The combined case is now mandatory in the default gate. Focused sync GC/poison
checks pass **9/9 per tier**; the ordinary sync sweep passes **51/51**.

Full input baseline: **5,220 passed, 3 failed, 1 skipped** across 106 executables
(5,224 tests). Only the already recorded LI-001 parser budget, LI-002 external-parent
expectation and LI-012 tar fixture fail; the font-dependent emoji test skips.
Full Lambda baseline: **7,493/7,494**, with only the existing TeX/expl3 golden
mismatch. These results do not mark those unrelated issues resolved.

Evidence: input `temp/li016/{before-source.json,after.json,mem_context.log,
mem_factory.log,mempool.log,input-baseline.log}`, Lambda
`temp/li016/{final-matrix.json,final-combined-*.log,final-stress-*.log,
lambda-baseline.log}` and the
[cloud implementation record](<../../lambda/vibe/impl/Lambda_Impl_Sync_Cloud (done).md>).
The former Lambda blocker is removed. LI-015 concurrent administration remains
separate and open.

<details><summary>Original observation and investigation — 2026-11-11</summary>

**Status:** OPEN — ownership cause unconfirmed; stack observation is in input/lib
cleanup, not proof of a provider defect. **Observed:** 2026-11-11, copied macOS
native host in Lambda's isolated `temp/sync-cloud/worktree`, interpreter and AUTO.
**Lambda blocker:** yes for the additional combined cloud-poll/peer-listener agent
acceptance case; ordinary one-shot cloud exchange/recovery passes independently.
D9.1.1v4, D6.3.3 and D11.1.2 apply. No sibling source was changed.

Run `test/sync_cloud/test_cloud.py` against the real local S3 test store. The final
combined case starts `cloud_cli.ls` action `run`, with four iterations and a
60-second cloud interval, and completes a peer transfer into that repository.
The peer client exits successfully and file bytes are installed, but the combined
agent does not finish within the existing 180-second test deadline. Both
interpreter and AUTO cases time out; no timeout was raised or harness patched.

The interpreter process reports completion (`executed=1`, about 172M nodes and
2334.50 MiB peak RSS) in its diagnostics before the driver timeout. A one-second
macOS stack sample finds the main thread in `lambda_main_finish` ->
`InputManager::destroy_global` -> `InputManager::reset_inputs` ->
`input_release_document_resources` -> `mem_context_destroy` ->
`destroy_ctx_locked` (`lib/mem_context.c:238`). Process inspection shows a CPU-bound
exit with a large memory footprint. Determine whether this is input/lib graph
teardown, an upstream Lambda ownership error, or pathological accumulated cleanup;
no cycle, allocator corruption or exact shared cause is confirmed.

Evidence relative to the Lambda checkout:
`temp/sync-cloud/worktree/temp/sync-cloud/combined-failure-{interp,auto}.log`,
`combined-evidence/{interp,auto}/31-run.err`, and
`agent-sample.txt`. The full process gate preserves this failure under
`--combined`; its ordinary cloud checks must not be represented as passing the
blocked combined gate. Combined-agent qualification work is stopped. Do not
change sibling sources, suppress teardown, extend timeouts, or add a process-exit
workaround from Lambda. Owner investigation is needed before advertising this
additional combined command as qualified.

### LI-010 — TeX expl3 format startup exceeds Lambda's five-second debug test target

**Status:** RESOLVED — denied-format recursion stopped and TeX macro expansion
tuned. **Observed:** 2026-11-10,
Lambda HEAD `5c0d7c68c5f5dde248d6d951ec85b6d62f928569`, macOS arm64, debug.
**Lambda blocker:** no; both `AmbientExplThreeFormatIsNotAnAuthorityCache`
cases now meet the five-second target in the measurements below. Authority: **D9.1.1v4 /
D9.1.3v2** (ownership), **D10.2.2** (TeX expansion), **D11.2.1** (authority).

After rebuilding Lambda against the input archive, reproduce from `../lambda` with
`./test/test_security_runtime_gtest.exe --gtest_filter='InterpreterAndJit/SecurityRuntimeTest.AmbientExplThreeFormatIsNotAnAuthorityCache/*'`.
Before the fix, both cases passed but took 13.883 s and 8.482 s consecutively
in one process.
The user's target is less than five seconds per case without weakening the
trusted-format control or the scoped authority denial.

A three-second CPU sample of case `/0` places all 1,559 main-thread samples in
`tex::engine_create -> load_expl3_format -> build_expl3_image -> run_preload`,
including macro expansion, token scanning and temporary token-array allocation.
The test body calls the input-owned engine API directly; neither Lambda tier
execution nor MIR codegen lies on this sampled path. Relevant owner symbols:
`lambda/input/input-tex-main.cpp:927` (`engine_create`) and
`lambda/input/input-tex-format.cpp:535,559` (`build_expl3_image`,
`load_expl3_format`). The original warm `/1` cause was not sampled; expensive
image load/kernel setup was an unconfirmed candidate. A scoped engine must
build privately instead of trusting the ambient format.

Evidence: `../lambda/temp/test-runtime-tuning/security-before.log`,
`security-before.json`, `security-sample.txt`, and `security-profile.log`.

**Resolution:** When a requested expl3 format could not be built or loaded, the
kernel entry-point stubs retried `\RequirePackage{expl3}` until the
20-million-expansion budget expired. The engine now stops at that request
with `tex-expl3-unavailable`, after the scoped client has denied access.
Macro calls also avoid a temporary output list: parameterless bodies are
read from their arena-backed definitions, and substituted bodies are written
directly to the existing pooled input buffer. Expansion limits and private
format builds remain in force.

**Verification:** The Lambda security test was rebuilt from current source
against the modified input archive in this project's `temp/`. Three consecutive
processes passed both cases in 4.036–4.304 s cold and 4 ms warm per process
(`temp/li010-after.log`). The input TeX regression tests cover denied file
classification and reads, authorized private loading, first-request restart,
macro substitution, redefinition, and expansion budgets. All 151 recorded TeX
conformance lines match, and the expl3 package fixture expands identically with
ambient and authorized scoped resource access. The native fixture runners are
`temp/li010-conformance.cpp` and `temp/li010-expl3.cpp`.

<a id="li-009"></a>

### LI-009 — Shared-header migration blocks Lambda release tuning build

**Status:** RESOLVED — normal input and Lambda release builds passed after the owner header repair and Lambda consumer migration.
**Observed:** 2026-11-10, Darwin arm64, input HEAD `0b49aa017d` plus its
uncommitted shared-header migration. **Lambda blocker:** yes, candidate release
build for the Result55 regression-tuning task. Authority: **D9.1.1v4 /
D9.1.3v2** (source ownership), **D6.3** (shared runtime ABI).

From `../Lambda-opus`, reproduce with
`make build-lambda-split SPLIT_PROFILE=release SPLIT_OUTPUT=temp/result55_tuning/candidate1 JOBS=4`.
The input release build fails compiling `lib/datetime.c` with a conflicting
`DateTime` typedef (`lib/datetime.h:35` struct versus `lambda/lambda.h:592`
uint64_t), and compiling `lib/document_lifetime_guard.cpp` with unknown
`MemCategory` at `lib/string.h:42`. The latter include chain is
`mem.h -> memtrack.h -> lambda/lambda.h -> lib/datetime.h -> lib/string.h`,
which reaches the string API before the MemCategory declaration.

Complete compiler evidence:
`../Lambda-opus/temp/result55_tuning/build-candidate1.log` (lines 93–187).
Expected: the normal input release build succeeds with the shared headers
self-consistent in C and C++. These are observed include/type failures; the
intended final header layering is an owner decision. Header contents changed
again during diagnosis (datetime.h now forward-declares StrBuf), so the log
qualifies the failed build's source state, not a subsequent owner fix. No
input source or build rule was edited by the Lambda task. Lambda compiler
experiments remain unqualified until the normal release build succeeds.

**Verification, 2026-11-10:** the owner's subsequent header changes removed
the reported DateTime/MemCategory failures. A retry overlapped an active owner
curl build and failed with missing `conftest` files; process inspection confirmed
the concurrent configure/build. After that job finished, the normal split
release build reached Lambda and exposed stale `lib/lambda_api.h` and
`lib/lambda_alloca.h` consumers. Lambda-owned callers now use a shared
visibility-only wrapper over `lambda/lambda.h` and the existing `lib/alloca.h`.
The complete normal release build exited 0 and produced the unchanged-compiler
control at `../Lambda-opus/temp/result55_tuning/control`. Evidence:
`../Lambda-opus/temp/result55_tuning/build-control-migrated2.log`.
This task changed no input implementation/header/build source; owner edits
remain independently owned. Lambda tuning can resume.

<a id="li-006"></a>

### LI-006 — Region retirement needs the shared map allocator declaration updated

**Status:** RESOLVED — approved shared-header edit applied and verified on
2026-11-10. **Lambda blocker:** no. Authority: **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2**
(header ownership), **D6.3** (GC ownership).

The user explicitly approved the one-file exception for input-owned
`lambda/lambda.h`. The applied change exactly matches the reviewed patch at
`../lambda/temp/mvp_region_retirement/input-header.patch`: remove the region
opaque type and region-only declarations, and change
`map_alloc_for_type(TypeMap*, LambdaRegion*, int64_t)` to the GC-only
`map_alloc_for_type(TypeMap*, int64_t)`. No other input/Radiant source or header
was edited by Lambda for this retirement. The change remains uncommitted.

Lambda removed the allocator, block/cache helpers, heap cache fields, teardown
and region JIT entries, and migrated all 19 existing native calls plus MVP's
emitted call and import metadata. Input and Radiant have no implementation
callers. The former owner boundary was the only dependency blocking complete
retirement; no compatibility argument or alternate API was introduced.

Verification: input and Radiant archives and the private Lambda release rebuild
successfully. A tracked-source audit across all three projects finds no retired
region names. Nine selected native/profiling GTests, seven focused Python unit
methods, six JS map-growth/GC cases, four typed/untyped tree benchmark goldens
and four diagnostic root/memory parity cases pass. No owner or Lambda/Radiant
baseline suite was run. Receipts and source/binary identities:
`../lambda/temp/mvp_region_retirement/`; implementation record:
`../lambda/vibe/impl/Lambda_Impl_MIR_MVP_Regions_and_Profiling.md`.

The original issue was retained Full MIR declarations in the owner header,
not a reproduced input parser failure. The prior caller inventory/reproduction
is recorded in `../lambda/temp/mvp_region_retirement/source-audit.json`.

<a id="li-008"></a>

### LI-008 — ZIP output cannot store one entry uncompressed

**Status:** RESOLVED — per-file compression override implemented 2026-11-10.
**Observed:** 2026-11-10. **Lambda blocker:** no. Lambda's `.painting` files
are valid ZIPs without it.

ZIP output applied one `compression` option (`'deflate'` or `'stored'`) to every
entry. The method came from `write->method` in `lambda/input/input-zip.cpp` and
`options.method` in `lambda/io/zip_archive.cpp`. Container formats in the ODF,
OpenRaster and Krita `.kra` style require their first entry, `mimetype`, to be
stored uncompressed so file-type sniffers can read it at a fixed offset.
Lambda's painting files (`lambda.paint`, `Lambda_Pkg_Paint.md` PT12) follow that
layout but could only write `mimetype` first and deflated. Entry order is kept
when `deterministic` is false.

The original reproduction wrote
`<fs kind: 'dir', <fs name: "mimetype", kind: 'file', "x">>` with
`output(tree, path, {format: 'zip'})`; reading it with `input(path, 'zip')`
reported `'deflate'`, with no per-file way to select `'stored'`.

The constructed-file `compression` attribute now selects `'stored'` or
`'deflate'` for that file, overriding the archive default (S10.1.4). Absent
attributes inherit the default, while captured archive-node compression remains
source metadata. See [ZIP output](../README.md#zip-output) for an example and
the ordering and ZIP64 constraints on fixed-offset payloads.

Verification: `ZipTest.ConstructedFilesOverrideArchiveCompression` reproduced
both ignored override directions before the fix. Afterward all 35 cases in
`build/test/test_zip_gtest` passed, including fixed-offset payload, invalid
values, archive defaults, captured nodes, and deterministic ZIP64 coverage.

<a id="li-004"></a>

### LI-004 — Shared Lambda header retains retired Full MIR helper declarations

**Status:** RESOLVED — declarations retired on 2026-11-10. **Observed:** 2026-11-10.
**Lambda blocker:** no; Lambda has no remaining source/import/export consumer.
Authority: **D9.1.1v4 / D9.1.3v2** (header ownership), **D9.4.6** (host exports).

Lambda's follow-up to source retirement at `fd07a893f` removes 47 runtime helper
entry points. Its additional compiler/private-analysis cleanup stays Lambda-owned.
The caller audit covers current Lambda/MVP/T0/JS, tests, generated-name patterns,
assembly aliases, Jube export lists, and tracked input/Radiant sources. The
remaining references to removed helpers were 30 declarations in input-owned
`lambda/lambda.h`; Lambda did not edit that header. The input owner removed those
declarations after review.
No source consumer or host-export dependency was found. In particular,
`fn_call3_into` is **retained** because Radiant calls it through an assembly alias;
`fn_call_boxed_1_into` is retained for imported constrained-type predicates.

Reproduce the declaration inventory from the Lambda checkout with
`python3 temp/mvp_helper_retirement/helper_candidates.py` (audit input saved
before deletion), or read
`temp/mvp_helper_retirement/remaining-references.json` and `removed.json`.
Source proof and qualification status are tracked in
`vibe/impl/Lambda_Impl_MIR_Full_Retirement.md` in Lambda. This is coordinated API
cleanup from the retirement change, not a demonstrated input parser defect.

Verification: the debug input archives built successfully; tracked C, C++,
assembly and Python sources in input, Lambda and Radiant have no exact references
to the 30 names. `fn_call3_into` and the runtime unary boxed-call trampoline
remain. All 43 `MarkReaderTest` cases pass. The boundary dependency audit passes
when it reads the debug-profile object directory; the unmodified `make
check-boundary` target fails due to **LI-005**.
